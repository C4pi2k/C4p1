# C4p1-Website README
My attempt at creating a personal website.

## What is it?
This whole thing is supposed to be my personal website. Yet at the same time, I want to gain some experience in creating a website, including the most crutial parts (frontend, backend, database). As soon as the website is more or less running, I would like to use it as a playground too (e.g. getting certain types of data from APIs and displaying them accordingly)

## What technologies are used?
### Frontend - Angular TS
For the frontend I am using Angular (TypeScript). Idk, it seems like a widely used framework and it feels like it provides a good bunch of common knowledge when it comes to creating a solid frontend. Especially focused on design (since I lack quite some css knowledge) and getting some experience with Angular.

### Backend - Express JS
For my backend I am using express js. Idk, I know some express js. It mostly serves as an opportunity to focus a bit more on the frontend instead of the backend.

### Database - MongoDB
For my database I am using a mongoDb cluster. Why you ask? Idk either.

## What is planned?
So far I am planning to create at least 4 pages. On the about me page, I wanna introduce visitors to get to know me real quick. On the coding playground I would like to implement any sort of code, that is not worth its own view (e.g. fancy html/css constructs that I found somewhere) and try out my own creations. On the articles page, I would like to write some articles about my own vies. That one might get locked up behind a login, since it might get personal. That way I do have an incentive to make my site actually "secure".
